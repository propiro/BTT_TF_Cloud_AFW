## Download
The latest release can be found here: https://github.com/AlbrechtL/BTT_TF_Cloud_AFW/releases

## Installing
**`esptool.py`** is needed for the flashing AFW initially. Please visit https://github.com/espressif/esptool for details.

A backup of the original firmware is always recommended. Read the section "Backup of original firmware", please.

### Over-the-Air (OTA)
This options is only available if you already have an installed AFW.

* Download the latest release
* Open a web browser
* Browse to `http://<your IP>/webota`
* Select the AFW firmware e.g. `BTT-SD-TF-Cloud_AFW_0.1.bin`
* Click update

### Windows

* Download the latest release and save it on your hard drive.
* Download last relase of Tasmotizer from `https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer/releases/`
* Run Tasmotizer with admin priviliges.
* Select "BIN file"checkbox and open the AFW firmware you've just downloaded e.g. `BTT-SD-TF-Cloud_AFW_0.1.bin`
* Connect your BIGTREETECH SD-TF card using usb cable, while pressing BOOT button on it.
* Select COM port you have your device connected through USB Cable, by default its COM1, but after clicking REFRESH, it should detect COM port automatically (`https://i.imgur.com/h7E2k0R.jpg`).
* Click "Tasmotize!", wait for process to finish. 
* todo - add picture of tasmotizer to local repo instead of external link.

### Linux
* Download the latest release
* Disconnect the BTT TF Cloud device from the SD card slot. **WARNING: If you don't do this you can damage your device with the SD or miroSD slot.**
* Connect it via USB
* Discover which serial interface is used
* Start `esptool.py -p <your serial port> write_flash 0x0000 <your download firmware.bin>`
Example:

```
# esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x0000 BTT-SD-TF-Cloud_AFW_0.1.bin 
```

* Wait until `esptool.py` reports `Connecting..`

```
esptool.py v3.0
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0

## Usage

### WiFi Config
If no WiFi settings are stored the device opens a new access point with the SSID `BTT_TF_CLOUD_AFW`. 

**How to set up**

* Connect via to the WiFi `BTT_TF_CLOUD_AFW`
* Browse to `http://192.168.4.1`
* Configure your requested WiFi
* Save

**How to reset your config**

* Power on the device
* Press the `BOOT` button up to 5 seconds until the LED is starting to blink
* Release the button
* When the LED is off the device reboots
* Proceed like above

### WebDAV Server 
This project is a WiFi WebDAV server using ESP8266 SoC. It maintains the filesystem on an SD card.

Supports the basic WebDav operations - *PROPFIND*, *GET*, *PUT*, *DELETE*, *MKCOL*, *MOVE* etc.

Once the WebDAV server is running on the ESP8266, a WebDAV client like Windows can access the filesystem on the SD card just like a cloud drive. The drive can also be mounted like a networked drive, and allows copying/pasting/deleting files on SD card remotely.

To access the drive from Windows use the Map Network Drive menu in Windows Explorer with the address ``http://<BTT_IP>:8080``.
Runs at port 8080


### FTP Server
The FTP server is tested with [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). If you would like to use another FTP client read the limiations, please.

Runs at port 21

**Limitations**

* The LIST command is not supported so the most FTP clients will not work
* Only supports passive FTP mode
* No encryption
* Accepts only 1 connection at the same time

**FileZilla Settings**

Please apply the following settings to FileZilla.

* Set maximum simultaneous transfers to 1
![Transfer Settings](pics/FileZilla_Transfer_Settings.png)

* Disable treat files without extensions as ASCII file. This options is enabled by default and can results in broken binary files.

## Building
PlatformIO (https://platformio.org/) is required and it should install the dependencies automatically.

### How to
1. Open PlatformIO

2. Open the folder with this repository

3. Build it

4. Connect your PC to the device  
**WARNING: Don't insert the BTT device the same time in a SD slot because of back feeding the voltage or remove the LM1117 voltage regulator (see below)!**

5. Upload it to the device
6. When PlatformIO (esptool) is trying to connect to the BTT device press and hold the BOOT switch and hit the RST switch a shot of time.

```
Uploading .pio/build/esp12e/firmware.bin
esptool.py v2.8
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting........_____..
```

8. Wait until the flash process is done

9. Reset the device again with the RST switch.

## Technical Stuff
### Backup of original firmware
* Backup the original firmware by using the command `esptool.py -p <your serial port> read_flash 0x0000 0x400000 BTT_Original_Firmware.bin`

```
# esptool.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 read_flash 0x00000 0x400000 BTT_Original_Firmware.bin
```
* Wait until `esptool.py` reports `Connecting..`

```
esptool.py v3.0
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting........_____.....___
```

* First, press and hold the BOOT push button and second press the RST push button
* Release both buttons at the same time
* The reading process should run now

*HINT: Your can find the original firmware also inside the folder "original_firmware" in this repo.*

### Pinout

BTT TF Cloud hardware uses the following SD card connections:

ESP Module|SD Card
---|---
GPIO13|MOSI   
GPIO12|MISO   
GPIO14|SCK    
GPIO4|CS   
GPIO5|CS Sense

### Schematic
The real BTT TF Cloud schematic is fully documented and may different from the following schematics. At the official GitHub repo (https://github.com/bigtreetech/BTT-SD-TF-Cloud-V1.0) only a few information can be found.

It looks like that the BTT TF Cloud is using a schematic like this one: https://3dtoday.ru/blogs/massaraksh7/sd-karta-s-wifi-na-esp8266-dlya-3d-printera-plug-and-play?fbclid=IwAR3Re1DvyVIkiezvatVK9iViC1FurmdtnGOtBKMQJc4QwWB763S28cFTv2s

![Russion Schematic](https://3dtoday.ru/cache/870x/posts/main/bHCD0h6paVG60ASXC9OQibvKpowjxwTuIoDGJfiI.png)

Here is another sample schematic which is similar to the BTT TF Cloud devices.

### Remove of LM1117 
To connect the ESP8266 to USB and let the device connected via SD it is necessary to remove the LM1117 voltage regulator. In all other cases it is not necessary to remove it!

NOTE: It seems that the ESP8266 is not booting with removed LM1117 and **unconnected** USB +5V power.
